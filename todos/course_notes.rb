# We transitioned session data to database_persistence.rb file
# Added "pg" gem to our Gemfile -> bundle install

############################# DATABASE_PERSISTENCE #############################
- we moved our class into this file.
- connect to db using gem "pg"

...
require "pg"

  def initialize
    @db = PG.connect(dbname: "todos")
  end
...

########################### LOGGING DATABASE QUERIES ###########################
- we can track in our CLI each DB request made.
- ex:

"Version 1: print out to console each SQL statement"
...
  def all_lists
    sql = "SELECT * FROM lists;"
    puts "#{sql}" # this will output in CLI every time we access all_lists in our app and in the browser
    result = @db.exec(sql)

    result.map do |tuple|
      {id: tuple["id"], name: tuple["name"], todos: []}
    end
  end
...

- BUT! well end up doing this for every method...
- new method "query(sql_statement, *params)" # sql statement and any/all parameters
  to be used across our many methods in our DatabasePersistance class

"Version 2: Sinatra offers a logging"

# todo.rb
  before do
    @storage = DatabasePersistance.new(logger)
  end

# database_persistence.rb
  def initialize(logger)
    @db = PG.connect(dbname: "todos")
    @logger = logger
  end

  def query(sql_statement, *params)
    # splat operator always results in an array, hence why we dont need to
    #   surround the argument in [] before passing it into exec_params
    @logger.info("#{sql_statement}: #{params}")
    @db.exec_params(sql_statement, params)
  end

######################### LOADING RECORDS FROM DATABASE #########################

- as we were transitioning our session data over to our DB,
    and as we query from SQL, data returned are strings. We noticed that a bool
    value in a method was checking values of "t" and "f" and in Ruby, objects are truthy.

# todo.rb
# method having an issue

def todos_remaining_count(list)
  list[:todos].count { |todo| !todo[:completed] }
end

# database_persistence.rb
    def all_lists
      sql = "SELECT * FROM lists;"
      result = query(sql)

      result.map do |tuple|
        list_id = tuple["id"].to_i
        todo_sql = "SELECT * FROM todos WHERE list_id = $1"
        # this will return PG result object that contains data for every row in todos table with matching list_id
        todos_result = query(todo_sql, list_id)

        todos = todos_result.map do |todo_tuple|
          { id: todo_tuple["id"].to_i,
            name: tuple["name"],
            completed: todo_tuple["completed"] == "t" } # this solves our issue in string "t" from DB vs. boolean in Ruby.
        end

        {id: list_id, name: tuple["name"], todos: todos}
      end
    end


######################### SOLVING THE RELOADING PROBLEM #########################

- any code outside of todo.rb when changed, needs to kill and restart the server.
- why? require "sinatra/reloader"

defining a route, or helper or any functionality in Sinatra it requires a reload

- our database_persistence.rb file doesnt have that reloader.

Solution -> within todo.rb and configure block:

configure do
  enable :sessions
  set :session_secret, 'secret'
  set :erb, :escape_html => true
  also_reload "database_persistence.rb" # included extension of the file .rb, different than Ruby require system
end

########################### DEVELOPMENT CONFIGURATION ###########################

- if you recall, Sinatra knows what environment were in via the rack.env variable
- Sinatra provides "development?" method and returns a bool value.

in our todo.rb app, we can set another configure block to handle all things we want in development

configure(:development) do
  require "sinatra/reloader"
  also_reload "database_persistence.rb"
end

this helps fix code reload after its been sent into production and any related issues.

########################## DEPLOYING PG APPS TO HEROKU ##########################

1. Make sure code works and you can commit to git repo locally.

2. - Specify Ruby version in Gemfile
   - Add puma to gemfile
   - run bundle install
   - add Procfile
   - Verify that everything is working -> heroku local
   - make sure that any development specific code wont run in production

3. Update code to open DB like this:
This code uses the DATABASE_URL environment variable to determine the database name when running on Heroku.

# @db = if Sinatra::Base.production?
#         PG.connect(ENV['DATABASE_URL'])
#       else
#         PG.connect(dbname: "todos")
#       end

4. Create an application on Heroku by running heroku apps:create within the projects directory:
Use your own Heroku login name or any unique string in place of xyzzy, and use an appropriate app name for the 180-todos part.

actually used: heroku apps:create sql-ruby-180-todos

# $ heroku apps:create xyzzy-180-todos
# Creating â¬¢ xyzzy-180-todos... done
# https://xyzzy-180-todos.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/xyzzy-180-todos.git

5. Create db on Heroku
# $ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev -a=sql-ruby-180-todos

6. If you have some code to create your database in schema.sql, you can create the database by running:
# $ heroku pg:psql < schema.sql -a=sql-ruby-180-todos

7. Were using Herokus free hobby-dev PostgreSQL database plan, which only allows for a
   maximum of 20 open database connections at once. If we exceed this limit, then our
  application will throw an error. Add the following code into your application to
  ensure that you dont exceed that 20 connection limit.

#todo.rb
# after do
#   @storage.disconnect
# end

#database_persistence.rb
# def disconnect
#   @db.close
# end

8. Commit any changes you made above.

9. Deploy the application to Heroku using git push heroku master
  (if youre working on a branch other than master, youll need to use its name in this command instead).
